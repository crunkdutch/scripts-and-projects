		 * The reveal method is most useful when you're trying to maintain the fidelity of the starting animation piece, 
		 * after the panel expansion has taken place. Previously this was difficult, as it was only available in I.E. 
		 * and it rendered all rollover functionality below the creative stage inactive. 
		 * The reveal method now makes it possible to have incredibly seamless expansions, as well as maintain user data and 
		 * states even after the user rolls off the panel. 
		 * <p>A common usage of the reveal function is when you have an Expandable Video ad that need to be built all as one flash file. 
		 * This would essetially be a TomBoy that breaks the barriers of the ad unit. In this case you can reveal and unreveal the transparent area as needed. </p>
		 * 
		 * <p>There are only certain cases you would want to use this technique. You will lose several reporting metrics using this 
		 * method therefore whenever possible your expanding ads should be built as FatBoys.</p>
		 * <p>The reveal method expands the panel to a specified height and width, with a x and y offset for use with expandable video. 
		 * You need to determine the pixel size of the space you want exposed (width and height). These are passed in as the w and h parameters.
		 * You need to determine the offset from the top-left corner of the panel where the "exposed" area starts. 
		 * These are passed in as the x and y parameters. The x and y parameters are optional. </p>
		 * 
		 * <p>If the exposure window starts in the upper left (at 0,0) of the panel space, then you donâ€™t need to bother passing the parameters at all.
		 * So if you want only a 300x250 space to be exposed and that 300x250 block is 200 pixels from the far left edge of the panel and 100 
		 * pixels down from the top edge of the panel, then the parameters would be like this... <code>reveal(300,250,200,100)</code>.</p>
		 * <p>You would use the <code>unReveal()</code> method to hide the transparent area until the user interacts to expand that out. 
		 * You would then reveal that area. Afterwards when the user causes it to retract then you can invoke unReveal again to hide the area. </p>

		 * @param	w  width of what you'd like to expand or hide the panel to
		 * @param	h  height of what you'd like to expand or hide the panel to
		 * @param	x	x offset
		 * @param	y	y offset
		 * @param	track	By default, the <code>reveal</code> method tracks an activity when called. You may optionally set the <code>track</code> 
		 * 					parameter to <code>0</code> if you do not wish to track the activity.
		 * @see PointRoll#unReveal() unReveal()

		 * 
		 * In this case you can reveal and unreveal the transparent area as needed.
		 * 
		 * <p>The unReveal method sets the collapsed display parameters for the ad - essentially "hiding" anything outside of that area.  You need to 
		 * determine the pixel size of the space you want exposed (width and height). These are passed in as the w and h parameters.</p>
		 * 
		 * <p>You need to determine the offset from the top-left corner of the panel where the "exposed" area starts. These are passed in as the x and y

		 * need to bother passing the parameters at all.</p>
		 * 
		 * <p>General use of this feature will be likely be to initially call the function for an "unReveal" at the very beginning (like frame 1) to set 
		 * the initial display window, like unReveal(728,90) for example. </p>
		 *

		 *
